Discussion
This program would be much easier to write if we could assume that the user's input was in the correct format. Unfortunately, the exercise says that we have to detect errors in the user's input and handle them by printing error messages. To do this we have to constantly look ahead while reading the user's input, to see whether the input agrees with what we are expecting. The techniques for doing this were covered for the example LengthConverter2.java from section 8.2.2 of the textbook. We can use the function TextIO.peek() to look ahead at the next character in the user's input. We need to be able to skip past any blanks in the input. Instead of writing my own method to do that, I use the method TextIO.skipBlanks() in my program.

My program uses exceptions to handle the errors. Exceptions make it possible to organize the error-handling code in a straightforward way. When an error is discovered, an exception is thrown. The main program uses a try..catch statement to try to process one line of input. If an error occurs, the program does not crash. The error is caught, an error message is printed, and the program continues. I throw an error of type IllegalArgumentException when an error is found. This exception is a standard part of Java, but it might be better style to define a new error class to represent the specific type of error that occurs in this program.

My program uses a method named calc() to read and process one line of input. This method in turn uses another method, readSet() to read each of the two sets of integers from the input line. Without error handling, an algorithm for readSet() would be:

Start with an empty set.
Read the '[' that begins the set.
Repeat:
      Read the next number and add it to the set.
      If the next character is ']':
         break.
      Read the comma that separates one number from the next.
Read the ']'.
Return the set.

To turn this into a robust routine, we just have to check, before reading anything, that the next character is legal. If not, throw an exception. This adds a lot of code, but the nice thing about throwing exceptions is that it doesn't disturb the logical flow of the routine.

There is one possible bug in the algorithm. It assumes that there is at least one number in the set. But in mathematics, a set can be empty. I decided to allow for the possibility of empty sets in my program. See the solution, below.

An algorithm for the calc() method is even more straightforward. Again, the basic algorithm ignores the possibility of errors:

Read the first set, A.
Read the operator.
Read the second set, B.
if the operator is '+'
   A.addAll(B) // Sets A equal to the union of A and B.
else if the operator is '*'
   A.retainAll(B) // Sets A to the intersection.
else
   A.removeAll(B) // Sets A to the difference.
Print A.

In the program, an error check has to be added to make sure that there is a legal operator in the correct position. I also add an error check to make sure that there is no extra data on the line.

The Solution
import java.util.TreeSet;

/**
 * This program is a very simple "set calculator" that can compute
 * the intersection, union, and set difference of two sets of
 * non-negative integers.  Each line of the user's input contains two
 * such sets, separated by one of the operators +, *, or -, standing
 * for union, intersection, and set difference respectively.  A set
 * must be given in the form of a list of non-negative integers, separated
 * by commas, and enclosed in square brackets.  For example:
 * [1, 2, 3] + [4, 3, 10, 0].  Spaces can occur anywhere in the input.
 * If an error is found in the input, the program will report it.
 * The program ends when the user inputs an empty line.
 *
 * This program is mainly a demonstration of Sets.
